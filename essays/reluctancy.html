<h2 id="choosing-my-degree">Choosing my degree</h2>

<p>When going into my Computer Science degree, I was completely unsure and hesitant with the degree choice. I didn’t have much prior experience with programming and though I had some exposure, they weren’t very encouraging. However, after a few semesters within the degree I began to take interest. I looked at my other options and they didn’t really seem appealing, Computer Science was the only degree that I had at least some interest in. That being said, I kept pushing it through. Now on my third year within the degree, and I’m still slightly uncertain, but with a little optimism.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-my-motivation">What is my motivation?</h2>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I find coding and programming fun and enjoyable, especially when you finish a long coding project that took hours to find out that there was a misplaced semicolon. The only issue I have is that I’m still bad at it and that I have so much more to learn, but I think that’s what’s making me want to keep pushing forward. Even though I’m reluctant and unconfident with my skills, the fact that I haven’t finished or at the very least reached my peak is preventing me from giving up. I realized throughout my time in this degree that I love problem solving. From simple problems like finding the most optimal way of getting to my classes to troubleshooting a resident’s connection issues, these are all obstacles that feel amazing after finding a solution to them. I may not have the experience or confidence for programming, but I am determined to see this all the way through.</p>

<h2 id="just-keep-going">Just keep going</h2>

<p>As I currently am right now, I don’t believe I have any skills nor the motivation to pursue a career that is programming heavy. Although my love for problem solving and my current occupation as a support specialist, makes my future goals lean more towards IT support. That being said, the skills and experiences that I hope to gain or develop more is problem solving and teamwork. It only makes sense that I want to further my problem solving skills. As being in IT support you must be able to understand what’s causing an issue for your clients and knowing the exact steps that the clients need to take to solve their problems. Teamwork, on the other hand, is one of the skills I wish to gain, as experience is the only way to improve this skill. I want to know how to work well with others and I want to be able to communicate my ideas well. I have such a hard time expressing myself and this often causes issues with my group members. I hope that through enough experiences, I begin to realize my own personal growth and development. I know I have a long way to go, but I know it would feel satisfying to see this through, as it would be basically finding a solution to a problem that’s gone for four years.</p>
