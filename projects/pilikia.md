## UHM Housing Service Request System

  I work as a support specialist for UHM housing, so I’m expected to help any resident with their technical and connection issues. Thus, I manage a service request site, only for UHM housing residents, named [Pilika](https://resnet.hawaii.edu/pilikia/). Where I only assist and manage the connection side of the website. This means that if a resident submits an issue with their connection, I'm expected to troubleshoot their issue and make sure they are no longer dealing with that problem.

## Guiding resident’s to a solution

  An example of my basic troubleshooting process that I go through with the resident, let’s say a resident states that they aren’t getting an internet connection whenever they connect to the UHM wifi. You would assume the issue is that they just have a poor connection and that we would need to find ways of increasing their signal strength. That wouldn’t be the case, as there are a lot that indicate other solutions when they state they aren’t getting an internet connection. The first thing I would ask is when they did try to connect to the UHM wifi if they are getting a login screen. Most of the time, the resident does have perfect connectivity, but they aren’t able to connect since the login screen isn’t popping up. I would then suggest they set up a [UHM passthrough](https://www.hawaii.edu/wireless/pt/). I would guide them through the process of finding the MAC address of their device and have them set it up on the website. I have them go through this because this completely bypasses the login screen and they won’t ever have to login into the UHM wifi any longer. 

## Gaining Experience
  This is one of many solutions that I have residents go through and it gets a lot more complicated if this one doesn’t work. Nevertheless, I have the responsibility of knowing what’s causing an issue with the resident and finding the most optimal solution. Managing the internet and connection side of the service request website has improved my problem-solving and communication skills. I’ve learned how to talk and communicate with different types of people and become more efficient at troubleshooting issues. Working as a support specialist really reminded me of how much I enjoy troubleshooting and how satisfying it feels to solve a person’s problems.
